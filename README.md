Advanced Deliverables

## As a user, You should be able to:
- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it and clicking the button "Enroll". The selected bot should
  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
